# **E-Commerce Sales Analysis Project Guide**

This guide outlines the **E-Commerce Sales Analysis Project**, designed for teams of 4-5 developers. The project will test your ability to build a comprehensive ETL pipeline in Databricks, focusing on **data accuracy, integrity, and scalability**. By the end of the project, you will deliver a presentation showcasing your pipeline, insights, and challenges faced.

---

## **Project Overview**
### **Objective**
Analyze e-commerce sales data to identify trends in customer behavior, product performance, and revenue generation. Build an end-to-end ETL pipeline in Databricks to ingest, transform, and analyze the data.

### **Dataset**
We will use the **Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset** from Kaggle, which contains transactional data from a real-world e-commerce platform. The dataset is publicly available and can be downloaded from the following link:

- **[Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)**

### **Main Tables**
| Table Name         | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **orders**         | Contains order-level information, including order status and timestamps.   |
| **customers**      | Contains customer IDs and their geographic locations.                      |
| **order_items**    | Contains details of items in each order, including product IDs and prices. |
| **products**       | Contains product-level information, including categories and descriptions. |
| **payments**       | Contains payment details for each order, including payment type and value. |

## **Project Stages and Deliverables**

### **1. Data Ingestion**
#### **Objective**
Ingest the raw data into Databricks and store it in a structured format (e.g., Delta Lake).

#### **Steps**
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle and upload it to Databricks (e.g., `/dbfs/tmp/ecommerce/`).
2. Load the CSV files into Spark DataFrames.
3. Save the raw data as Delta tables for efficient querying.

#### **Deliverables**
- **(10 points)** All raw tables are ingested into Databricks and stored as Delta tables.
- **(5 points)** A notebook demonstrating the ingestion process with clear documentation.

#### **Stretch Goals**
- **(5 points)** Simulate an automated ingestion process by creating a Databricks Workflow that schedules and runs your ingestion notebook at regular intervals (e.g., daily).
- **(5 points)** Implement schema validation to ensure data integrity during ingestion.

---

### **2. Data Cleaning and Transformation**
#### **Objective**
Clean and transform the raw data to prepare it for analysis.

#### **Steps**
1. Handle missing or null values (e.g., replace, drop, or impute).
2. Deduplicate records to ensure data accuracy.
3. Standardize column names and data types across all tables.
4. Create derived columns (e.g., total order value, order duration).

#### **Deliverables**
- **(15 points)** Cleaned and transformed tables stored as Delta tables.
- **(5 points)** A notebook demonstrating the cleaning and transformation process with clear documentation.

#### **Stretch Goals**
- **(5 points)** Implement data quality checks (e.g., row counts, null checks) and log the results.
- **(5 points)** Create a reusable transformation pipeline using PySpark functions or Delta Live Tables.

---

### **3. Data Integration**
#### **Objective**
Join the cleaned tables to create a unified dataset for analysis.

#### **Steps**
1. Join the `orders`, `customers`, `order_items`, `products`, and `payments` tables.
2. Create a unified dataset with key metrics (e.g., total revenue, number of items per order, customer location).
3. Store the integrated dataset as a Delta table.

#### **Deliverables**
- **(20 points)** A unified dataset stored as a Delta table.
- **(5 points)** A notebook demonstrating the integration process with clear documentation.

#### **Stretch Goals**
- **(5 points)** Create a star schema or snowflake schema for the integrated dataset.
- **(5 points)** Implement incremental updates to the integrated dataset using Delta Lake features.

---

### **4. Data Analysis**
#### **Objective**
Perform analysis to generate insights about sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.

#### **Steps**
1. Calculate key metrics:
   - Total revenue by month.
   - Top 10 products by sales.
   - Customer lifetime value (CLV).
2. Perform geographic analysis (e.g., revenue by state or region).
3. Identify trends in payment methods (e.g., most popular payment types).

#### **Deliverables**
- **(20 points)** A notebook with analysis results, including queries and visualizations.
- **(5 points)** At least three meaningful insights derived from the data.

#### **Stretch Goals**
- **(5 points)** Create advanced visualizations using Databricks SQL or integrate with Tableau/Power BI.
- **(5 points)** Implement predictive analytics (e.g., forecasting future sales using time-series models).

---

### **5. Final Presentation**
#### **Objective**
Present your project to the group, covering the pipeline, insights, and challenges faced.

#### **Steps**
1. Prepare a presentation that includes:
   - **Technologies utilized**: Highlight Databricks, Spark, Delta Lake, and any other tools used.
   - **Architecture diagram**: Show the flow of data through the ETL pipeline.
   - **ERD diagram**: Display the relationships between the tables.
   - **List of features implemented**: Summarize the key features of your pipeline.
   - **Queries answered**: Share the insights derived from your analysis.
   - **Outstanding defects/issues**: Discuss any unresolved challenges.
   - **Challenges faced**: Reflect on the difficulties encountered and how they were addressed.
2. Demo your pipeline and analysis results.

#### **Deliverables**
- **(30 points)** A well-structured presentation covering all required sections.
- **(10 points)** A live demo of your pipeline and analysis results.

#### **Stretch Goals**
- **(5 points)** Include a dashboard showcasing key metrics and insights.
- **(5 points)** Propose potential extensions to the project (e.g., integrating new data sources, implementing machine learning models).
